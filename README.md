## Known Issues

* **Some features are broken or do not work correctly** ![Priority](https://img.shields.io/badge/Priority-High-orange.svg) <br /> This project is still a work in progress, and I have focused on adding features while fixing things one by one. I aim to focus on fixing bugs before release. Feel free to create an issue ticket to track any problems you may find.
* **Right click menu is disabled or missing in OSX\Linux** ![Priority](https://img.shields.io/badge/Priority-Low-yellow.svg) <br /> The right click menu has been disabled due to a bug in Mono. Work arounds will be looked into at a later time. Low Priority as the menu can be accessed by clicking the icon to the left of the selected mod.

### Donations

ModList Backup and its source code is entirely available free of charge, and will never include advertisements or ask for money. Coding is my passion and my hobby.
